#Map My Linked
Map my linkedin allows for an easy way to map your LinkedIn Connections. It makes it simple to look for people you can meet up with in cities that you may be visiting or are in.


##Why?
One of my greatest issues with LinkedIn is that it can be a bit difficult to know your true connections. A friend (that's an excellent javascript developer) sends you a request and you'll accept. However in 6 months, you may forget that they're located in San Francisco or that they're still doing javascript development. This allows you to easily dive back into those connections to see who is in what area and what they currently do.


##How?

I'm using the LinkedIn API to access this information then Google Maps to display it. 

# Motivation
----

Learning how to program is hard and takes a lot of motivation. But when you're just doing small projects yourself it doesn't get much harder. I created this application so that other people can contribute at all different levels. See contributing below and you'll see how you can join me.

I got tired of looking at the to do list apps. They're great but that doesn't mean that I understand how that applies to backbone or angularjs. I need to get dirty and play around with things. The problem is that contributing to a real OSS project means a lot of people could end up depending on your code.

###How to get started





### To Do List

####Javascript/ Front End
* Clean up the "Person" Template
* Clean up the "Connection Template"
* Add new metrics to the "Connections" + Display those in the connection template

####Python Backend
* Right now there's no cleaning of locations and sometimes they'll return two people that are really close to one another as seperate locations. This can be improved by looking at what kinds of locations are returned by the application
