#Map My Linked
Map my linkedin allows for an easy way to map your LinkedIn Connections. It makes it simple to look for people you can meet up with in cities that you may be visiting or are in.


##Why?
One of my greatest issues with LinkedIn is that it can be a bit difficult to know your true connections. A friend (that's an excellent javascript developer) sends you a request and you'll accept. However in 6 months, you may forget that they're located in San Francisco or that they're still doing javascript development. This allows you to easily dive back into those connections to see who is in what area and what they currently do.


##How?

I'm using the LinkedIn API to access this information then Google Maps to display it.
